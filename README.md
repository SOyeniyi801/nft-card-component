## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

I picked this up to be a quick project to breeze through and ended up learning a crucial lesson in style inheritance. I had a hard time keeping the eye overlay image from taking on its parent's properties. The fix was as simple as placing another div and adjusting some styling, but I had to clear my mind to get there. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to practice more complex design projects, with more effects. I want to try my hand at a landing page next.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php) - This helped remember how to implement hover.
